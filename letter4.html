    <h3>the last princess</h3>
    <h4>Chapter 1: The Princess and the Rebel</h4>
<p>In the year 1857, the Indian subcontinent was in a state of turmoil. The British had been ruling India for nearly a century, and their oppressive policies and exploitative practices had led to widespread unrest and rebellion among the Indian people. It was in this context that the Sepoy Mutiny, also known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857, took place.<br>
Amidst this chaos and turmoil, there lived a young princess named Zainab. She was the daughter of the Nawab of Awadh, a powerful ruler who had allied with the British in exchange for his own wealth and power. Zainab had grown up in luxury and privilege, but she was not blind to the suffering of her people. She had seen firsthand the poverty and injustice that the British had brought to her kingdom, and she longed for a way to help her people and to end the British tyranny.<br>
One day, while she was out for a walk in the gardens of her palace, she came across a group of rebels who had been fighting against the British. They were led by a young man named Raza, who was known for his bravery and his passion for freedom. Zainab was immediately drawn to Raza's charisma and his fiery spirit. She felt a connection with him that she could not explain, and she knew that she wanted to be a part of his cause.<br>
But Zainab was also aware of the risks that came with defying the British. As a princess and a member of the ruling elite, she was expected to maintain her loyalty to the British and to follow their orders. She knew that if she were to join the rebellion, it could mean the end of her privileged life and perhaps even her own life.<br>
Despite these fears, Zainab felt a growing sense of urgency to do something to help her people. She knew that she could no longer remain silent and complacent in the face of the British oppression. She made the decision to approach Raza and offer her assistance to the rebel cause. It was a risky move, but it was one that she knew she had to make.<br>
As she approached Raza, she could feel her heart racing with excitement and fear. He looked up at her, and for a moment, their eyes locked in a silent understanding. Zainab knew that she had made the right decision. She was ready to fight for her people and for her own freedom, no matter what the cost.<br>
